# Too Many Efficiency Losses

This is the first time I've made a GitHub project, so my apologies if anything isn't done right.

Anyway, this is just the source code for the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/too-many-efficiency-losses">Too Many Efficiency Losses</a>. I'll be keeping this up to date.
